> This is a modification of Caligari87's [Ugly as Sin](https://github.com/caligari87/Ugly-as-Sin) medical module. All of the original code belongs to him.

side note: this is poorly fixed up, so do expect some weird bugs/inconsistency.

## Changes
 - You can now operate on not stabilised wounds with the Trauma Kit. (do note that you will still bleed out unless you seal the wound)
 - Stabilised wounds can still be sealed up with Second Flesh. (might nerf/change this)
 - Removed autostrip, because it doesn't exist.

## Technical changes
 - Cavity is based on the width of your wound
